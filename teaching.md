# Teaching

As part of a larger multi-scale course (credit to Joshua S. Weitz) I taught a module on understanding the structure and function of cells: including the molecular mechanisms governing mutation, gene expression and regulation, and evolution. During this module I taught how to analyze and model complex biological systems, emphazaising the stochasticity, and fluctuations inherent to biological systems. The teaching approach beyond lecturing, integrates hands-on tutorials, journal club discussions, problem solving exercises and final project development. Sudents acquire skills in the use of mathematical and computational tools, such as stability analysis of ode systems, memory-less stochastic models, ode integration and more. Overall, this module includes a broad range of analytical and problem-solving skills, which can be applied to many different fields within the biological sciences.
