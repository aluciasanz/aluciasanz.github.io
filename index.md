    <td>I'm currently a postdoctoral resercher at the <a href="https://www.ibv.csic.es/en/ibv/">Institute of Biomedicine of Valencia</a>. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech (Atlanta, US), in the group of <a href="https://weitzgroup.umd.edu/"> Prof. Joshua S. Weitz</a> from March 2020 to May 2024. I earned my PhD. on virus evolution under the supervision of <a href="https://auditore.cab.inta-csic.es/manrubia/">Prof. Susanna Manrubia</a> at the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain. My main research interest is trying to understand how biological systems behave, both quantitatively and qualitatively. I'm particularly interested in how to describe these systems at a very grounded level and in understanding how well models can capture the phenomena we observe in nature. I combine theoretical, computational and bioinformatic tools in my approach.
